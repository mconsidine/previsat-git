\page MajTLE TLE update

Even if the orbital elements in TLE format are destined to disappear, PreviSat has a <b>TLE update</b> tool to update them.

The <b>Auto TLE update</b> tab allows you to update the orbital elements of the satellites by downloading the files from the dedicated servers.

The <b>Manual TLE update</b> tab allows you to update the orbital elements of the satellites from a file already present on the computer.
