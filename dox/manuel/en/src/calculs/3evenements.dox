\page Evenements Orbital events

The <b>Orbital events</b> tab allows to determine the orbital events of the selected satellites. We can choose the events :
- The passes of the satellite to ascending and descending nodes (equatorial crosses),
- The passes to quadrangles (at position = 90° and 270°), that is to say the passes to the maximal latitudes,
- The passes to shadow/penumbra/light,
- The passes to apogee/perigee,
- And the terminator passes, that is to say the passes of the satellite over the day/night limit.
