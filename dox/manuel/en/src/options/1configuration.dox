This set of tabs contains a list of checkboxes classified by themes allowing to display (or not to display) elements in the graphic interface. Some checkboxes have 3 possible states :
<b>Name of satellites</b> box :
- <b>Checked</b> : the names of selected satellites are displayed,
- <b>Partially checked</b> (the display of the box varies with the system requirements) : the name of default satellite is displayed,
- <b>Unchecked</b> : the display of the names of satellites is disabled.

<b>Foot print</b> box :
- <b>Checked</b> : the foot prints of all selected satellites display,
- <b>Partially checked</b> : the foot print of the default satellite displays,
- <b>Unchecked</b> : the display of foot prints is disabled.

<b>Radar</b> box:
- <b>Checked</b> : the radar only displays if a satellite is present in the sky of the place of observation,
- <b>Partially checked</b> : the radar displays permanently,
- <b>Unchecked</b> : the display of the radar is disabled.

<b>Display of constellations</b> box :
- <b>Checked</b> : when the sky map is maximized, the constellation lines and names of constallation are displayed,
- <b>Partially checked</b> : constellation lines are displayed,
- <b>Unchecked</b> : the display of constellation lines and names of constellations are disabled.

<b>Name of locations</b> box :
- <b>Checked</b> : the names of all places of observation are displayed,
- <b>Partially checked</b> : the name of the default location displays, the other locations are represented by a white cross,
- <b>Unchecked</b> : the name of the default location displays.

In the <b>System</b> tab, a first makes it possible to choose the range units displayed in PreviSat. For the satellites as well as the Moon, the unit can be either kilometers, or miles (1 mile = 1.609344 km); the altitude of the place of observation and dimensions of the satellite are then expressed respectively in meters or feet (1 foot = 0.3048 m). The distance from the Sun is always given in astronomical units (1 AU = 149,597,870 km = 92,955,807 miles).

<b>Note</b> : After the entry of a new place of observation when the unit is the foot, the displayed altitude can slightly differ compared to the entered value, because PreviSat stores the altitude in meters and in a integer value. That does not affect any the calculations carried out by PreviSat.

A second choice list allows to display hours at 24h format or at 12h format (AM/PM).

A third choice list makes it possible to select the Local time - UTC offset; one can changes the value of this offset. The <b>Auto</b> checkbox, when it is checked, allows to determine automatically this offset :
- If the Auto checkbox is checked at the time of closing of PreviSat, the offset will be given with the system value at the next starting of Previsat.
- If not, the offset will be given by the value indicated in the field, at the next starting of PreviSat.

It is possible to save the display settings into a file.
